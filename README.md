# Small Scripts
Various utility scripts that I've written for the Mac's Bash shell. Those which have been turned into Automator workflows are in the Automator directory.

Larger Bash scripts have their own individual repositories on my GitHub account or else are linked to from my home page (see my profile), where links to all my released projects have been collected.
